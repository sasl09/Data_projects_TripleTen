![Zomato](images/zomato.png)

## Introduction: 

From what can be seen after running a few totals and averages on the data, it seems that sales are influenced by the type of food customers consume and the location of the venues. Nevertheless, we will of course get a much clearer picture of what is really happening with our data after creating visualizations of combined variables and characteristics (such as: Age, Gender, Monthly Income, Education Level, etc). <br>

It will be necessary to create new tables and columns with clean and filtered information and or calculations. Furthermore, it should be considered that certain variables be converted into categorical in order to find out if that conversion could prove useful to our analysis. <br>

## Process: 

-Power BI automatically joined the food-menu, orders-users tables as a Many to 1 relationship (*:1) on their row ID column and their user_id respectively. <br>
-Power BI automatically joined the menu-restaurant, menu-users tables as a 1 to 1 relationship (1:1) on their row ID column. <br>
-A new table called count_of_orders_quantities was created as a Many to 1 relationship (*:1) with the orders table. <br>
-A new table called orders_by_unique_customers was created as a 1 to 1 relationship (1:1) with the users table. <br>
-A new table called sales_by_customer was created as a 1 to 1 relationship (1:1) with the users table. <br>
-A new table called cohort_analysis_months was created in order to perform calculations for retention rates. There is no necessary relation with other tables. <br>
-A new column called price_clean was created in the menu table, in order to replace all blank rows with the average price per meal. <br>
-A new column called first_order_end_of_month was created in the orders table, in order to obtain the unique customers' first order date and convert it to the end of the month date. <br>
-A new column called cost_processed was created in the restaurant table, in order to replace all non-numerical signs from values. <br>
-A new column called cost_clean was created in the restaurant table, in order to replace all blank rows with the average cost per customer. <br>
-A new column called url_names was created in the restaurant table, in order to extract all restaurant names from the link column. <br>
-A new column called name_clean was created in the restaurant table, in order to replace all blank rows with the names of the restaurants extracted from the url_names column. <br>
-A new column called rating_clean was created in the restaurant table, in order to replace all blank rows with "No Rating". <br>
-A new column called rating_count_clean was created in the restaurant table, in order to replace all blank rows with "No Rating". <br>
